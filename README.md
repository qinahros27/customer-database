## Getting started
Clone the respository from github: ```git clone```

<!---## Requirements

Information of all the customers should be stored in a file called `customers.csv`. Initially, the program should read all the data from file and add data to the database. Any modification to the database should also recorded in the file `customers.csv`. The basic classes would be needed for this project (and create more if you have valid reasons to do so):

1. Create `Customer` class: This class represents a customer and should contain properties such as Id, FirstName, LastName, Email, and Address. You can decide the suitable data types for each.
2. Create `CustomerDatabase` class: This class should contain the data structure used to store customer information, such as a collection of customers. It should also contain methods for adding, reading, updating, deleting. Extra features:
    - Email should be unique in the database.
    - Implement a feature to search customers by their ID
    - Implement an undo and redo feature which allows users to undo their last action or redo an action that they have undone
3. Create `FileHelper` class: This class should contain methods for reading and writing customer information to and from the file system.
4. Create `ExceptionHandler` class: This class should contain methods for handling exceptions that may occur during the execution of the application. --->
